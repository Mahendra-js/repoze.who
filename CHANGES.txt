Unreleased

 - Allow a downstream application to reset the identity during egress
   (e.g. if a user changes his username or password and the
   application would rather not require that the he logs out and logs
   back in for the change to "take").  The application should set a
   key in the WSGI environment: 'repoze.pam.identity_reset', which
   should have a value that is an identity dictionary that can be
   consumed by the "remember" method of the identifier that was used
   for the current request.

 - Add 'repoze.pam.identifier' to environment on ingress, which will
   be the identifier plugin instance which gave PAM the identity that
   became REMOTE_USER (to support introspection by the application, so
   it has a shot at knowing the identity format before it sets the
   value of 'repoze.pam.identity_reset' ).

 - Allow "remote user key" (default: REMOTE_USER) to be overridden
   (pass in remote_user_key to middleware constructor).

 - Allow form plugin to override the default form.

0.4 (03-07-2008)

 - Allow plugins to specify a classifiers list per interface (instead
   of a single classifiers list per plugin).

0.3 (03-05-2008)

  - Make SQLAuthenticatorPlugin's default_password_compare use
    hexdigest sha instead of base64'ed binary sha for simpler
    conversion.

0.2 (03-04-2008)

  - Added SQLAuthenticatorPlugin (see plugins/sql.py).
