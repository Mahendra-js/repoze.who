Unreleased

 - Add a SQLMetadataProviderPlugin (in plugins/sql).

 - Change constructor of SQLAuthenticatorPlugin: it now accepts only
   "query", "conn_factory", and "compare_fn".  The old constructor
   accepted a DSN, but some database systems don't use DBAPI DSNs.
   The new constructor accepts no DSN; the conn_factory is assumed to
   do all the work to make a connection, including knowing the DSN if
   one is required.  The "conn_factory" should return something that,
   when called with no arguments, returns a database connection.

 - The "make_plugin" helper in plugins/sql has been renamed
   "make_authenticator_plugin".  When called, this helper will return
   a SQLAuthenticatorPlugin.  A bit of helper logic in the
   "make_authenticator_plugin" allows a connection factory to be
   computed.  The top-level callable referred to by conn_factory in
   this helper should return a function that, when called with no
   arguments, returns a datbase connection.  The top-level callable
   itself is called with "who_conf" (global who configuration) and any
   number of non-top-level keyword arguments as they are passed into
   the helper, to allow for a DSN or URL or whatever to be passed in.

 - A "make_metatata_plugin" helper has been added to plugins/sql. When
   called, this will make a SQLMetadataProviderPlugin.  See the
   implementation for details.  It is similar to the
   "make_authenticator_plugin" helper.

0.8 (2008-03-27)

 - Add a RedirectingFormIdentifier plugin.  This plugin is willing to
   redirect to an external (or downstream application) login form to
   perform identification.  The external login form must post to the
   "login_handler_path" of the plugin (optimally with a "came_from"
   value to tell the plugin where to redirect the response to if the
   authentication works properly).  The "logout_handler_path" of this
   plugin can be visited to perform a logout.  The "came_from" value
   also works there.

 - Identifier plugins are now permitted to set a key in the
   environment named 'repoze.who.application' on ingress (in
   'identify').  If an identifier plugin does so, this application is
   used instead of the "normal" downstream application.  This feature
   was added to more simply support the redirecting form identifier
   plugin.

0.7 (2008-03-26)

 - Change the IMetadataProvider interface: this interface used to have
   a "metadata" method which returned a dictionary.  This method is
   not part of that API anymore.  It's been replaced with an
   "add_metadata" method which has the signature:

    def add_metadata(environ, identity):
        """
        Add metadata to the identity (which is a dictionary)
        """

   The return value is ignored.  IMetadataProvider plugins are now
   assumed to be responsible for 'scribbling' directly on the identity
   that is passed in (it's a dictionary).  The user id can always be
   retrieved from the identity via identity['repoze.who.userid'] for
   metadata plugins that rely on that value.

0.6 (2008-03-20)

 - Renaming: repoze.pam is now repoze.who

 - Bump ez_setup.py version.

 - Add IMetadataProvider plugin type.  Chris says 'Whit rules'.

0.5 (2008-03-09)

 - Allow "remote user key" (default: REMOTE_USER) to be overridden
   (pass in remote_user_key to middleware constructor).

 - Allow form plugin to override the default form.

 - API change: IIdentifiers are no longer required to put both 'login'
   and 'password' in a returned identity dictionary.  Instead, an
   IIdentifier can place arbitrary key/value pairs in the identity
   dictionary (or return an empty dictionary).

 - API return value change: the "failure" identity which IIdentifiers
   return is now None rather than an empty dictionary.

 - The IAuthenticator interface now specifies that IAuthenticators
   must not raise an exception when evaluating an identity that does
   not have "expected" key/value pairs (e.g. when an IAuthenticator
   that expects login and password inspects an identity returned by an
   IP-based auth system which only puts the IP address in the
   identity); instead they fail gracefully by returning None.

 - Add (cookie) "auth_tkt" identification plugin.

 - Stamp identity dictionaries with a userid by placing a key named
   'repoze.pam.userid' into the identity for each authenticated
   identity.

 - If an IIdentifier plugin inserts a 'repoze.pam.userid' key into the
   identity dictionary, consider this identity "preauthenticated".  No
   authenticator plugins will be asked to authenticate this identity.
   This is designed for things like the recently added auth_tkt
   plugin, which embeds the user id into the ticket.  This effectively
   alllows an IIdentifier plugin to become an IAuthenticator plugin
   when breaking apart the responsibility into two separate plugins is
   "make-work".  Preauthenticated identities will be selected first
   when deciding which identity to use for any given request.

 - Insert a 'repoze.pam.identity' key into the WSGI environment on
   ingress if an identity is found.  Its value will be the identity
   dictionary related to the identity selected by repoze.pam on
   ingress.  Downstream consumers are allowed to mutate this
   dictionary; this value is passed to "remember" and "forget", so its
   main use is to do a "credentials reset"; e.g. a user has changed
   his username or password within the application, but we don't want
   to force him to log in again after he does so.

0.4 (03-07-2008)

 - Allow plugins to specify a classifiers list per interface (instead
   of a single classifiers list per plugin).

0.3 (03-05-2008)

  - Make SQLAuthenticatorPlugin's default_password_compare use
    hexdigest sha instead of base64'ed binary sha for simpler
    conversion.

0.2 (03-04-2008)

  - Added SQLAuthenticatorPlugin (see plugins/sql.py).

0.1 (02-27-2008)

  Initial release (no configuration file support yet).
